# Illustrative examples

Thanks to the brilliant expressiveness and low-overhead abstraction in Julia, we provide different levels of solution algorithm for modeling and simulating advection-diffusion dynamics.
The high-level solver is able to solve complex physics in a few lines, while the low-level APIs keep all the detailed implementations and benefit the secondary development.
The low-level methods are easy to be called from Python and C.
In the following, we present some quick tutorials to illustrate the usage of Kinetic.
For more examples, please refer the example directories in [Kinetic.jl](https://github.com/vavrines/Kinetic.jl/tree/master/example), [KitBase.jl](https://github.com/vavrines/KitBase.jl/tree/main/example) and [KitML.jl](https://github.com/vavrines/KitML.jl/tree/main/example).
